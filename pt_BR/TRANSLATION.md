# Portuguese (pt_BR) Translation

Here are a few comments on the Portuguese translation.

## Translators

Who participated in this effort:

* Camila Granella <https://github.com/camgranella>


## Notes

* "Open Decision Framework" was not translated throughout most of this document since, much like the German translation, there are no satisfactory terms in Portuguese for "framework".
Nevertheless, it was added one informative translation using the word "modelo" which, through research, came closest to the meaning in English.
"Open Source" was not translated as well, since it is widely known in Brazil and the exact translation refers only to "open source codes", not the complete meaning of this expression.

## Glossary

Below are some important terms whose translation is subject to interpretation. It is important to maintain a consistent translation of these terms across the entire project.

* **Associate**: "colaborador(es)"
* **Customer**: "cliente(s)"
* **Open source principles**: "princípios Open Source"
* **Stakeholders**: "partes interessadas"
* **Forking**: "derivações"
* **Flamewar**: "Common flamewar triggers" was translated to "Assuntos comumente controversos". Since there are no similar expressions in Portuguese, it was cross-checked with the French translation, and then added a sentence targeting the expression's meaning.
* **Upstream**: much like the "Open Source" note previously added, it was not translated since it's a widely known term in Brazil and the exact translation is not appropriate for this context.
* **Feedback**: same as "upstream".
<!-- **Term**: How you translated the term and explanation of why, if needed -->
